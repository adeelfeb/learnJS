# Understanding `this` and `.call()` Method in JavaScript

This README is designed to explain how the `this` keyword and the `.call()` method work in JavaScript, using a practical example based on code demonstrated by a YouTuber named Chai.

## Concepts Explained

1. **The `this` Keyword:**
   - The `this` keyword in JavaScript refers to the object that is executing the current piece of code.
   - When used inside a function, `this` refers to the object that called the function.

2. **The `.call()` Method:**
   - `.call()` is a method used to invoke a function and explicitly set the value of `this` inside that function.
   - It allows you to specify the object that should be treated as `this` when the function is executed.

## Code Explanation

Let’s break down the code step by step:

### 1. `SetUsername` Function

```js
function SetUsername(username) {
    // complex DB calls
    this.username = username;
    console.log("called");
}
```
- This function takes a `username` argument and assigns it to `this.username`.
- `this.username` refers to the property of an object that calls this function.
- It also logs "called" to the console when the function is executed.

### 2. `createUser` Constructor Function

```js
function createUser(username, email, password) {
    SetUsername.call(this, username); // Invokes SetUsername with 'this' referring to createUser's instance
   
    this.email = email;
    this.password = password;
}
```
- `createUser` is a constructor function, used to create new user objects.
- Inside this function, we invoke `SetUsername` using the `.call()` method.
  - **Why `.call()`?** 
    - By using `.call()`, we ensure that the `this` inside the `SetUsername` function refers to the instance of `createUser`, rather than some other object.
    - In this case, `this` refers to the new object being created by `createUser`.
- After calling `SetUsername`, it assigns `email` and `password` to the current instance (object) of `createUser`.

### 3. Creating a New User Instance

```js
const chai = new createUser("chai", "chai@fb.com", "123");
console.log(chai);
```
- We create a new instance of the `createUser` object using the `new` keyword.
- The `new` keyword:
  - Creates a new empty object.
  - Binds `this` inside the `createUser` function to the new object.
  - Returns the newly created object.
- The function `SetUsername` is called within `createUser`, assigning `"chai"` to the `username` property of the new object.
- The `email` and `password` properties are also assigned to this new object.

### 4. Console Output

```bash
called
createUser { username: 'chai', email: 'chai@fb.com', password: '123' }
```
- The console first logs `"called"` when the `SetUsername` function is executed.
- The `chai` object is printed, showing it has the properties `username`, `email`, and `password`.

## Summary

- The `.call()` method allows us to explicitly define the value of `this` inside a function.
- In this example, `SetUsername.call(this, username)` ensures that the `this` inside `SetUsername` refers to the instance of `createUser`.
- The `new` keyword creates an instance of `createUser`, initializing the object with the given `username`, `email`, and `password`.

This example showcases how `.call()` and `this` can be effectively used to manage object properties across functions in JavaScript.

This file will help you revisit the concepts of `this` and the `.call()` method whenever you need a refresher.
